# PHP API Client for Paps

<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aglipanci/Paps-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aglipanci/Paps-api) -->

A PHP client for consuming the [Paps API](https://developers.papslogistics.com/).

_This client is targeting the API version v2_.

## Install

Via Composer

```bash
$ composer require paps-app/paps-php-client
```

> The minimum required version of PHP is 5.6

## Usage

All the method listed below are the same documented on the RESTful API, so this guide won't be covering any params required for each method. Please, yout can however refer to the Examples sections.

### Create the client

First you'll need to initialize the client by providing your API. To get an API, visit [the documentation](https://developers.paps.sn/) and click on "Get a Key" button.

```php
$client = new Paps\PapsClient([
  'api_key' => '<Your API Key>'
]);
```

### Enter Test Mode

Please consider entering test mode when starting to experiment with this API. Note that under test mode, you have full control over your tasks. You can create, cancel, change your task statues or even delete them. But remember to hack responsibly ðŸ˜‰.

```php
$client = new Paps\PapsClient([
  'api_key' => '<Your API Key>',
  'mode' => 'test'
]);
```

### Create a delivery request linked to your main account on [Monespace](https://monespace.paps.sn/)

- Method : [`$delivery->createTaskForAPIUser($email = string, array $delivery_params = [], array $pickup_params = [])`](https://developers.paps.sn/create#cr%C3%A9ation-de-t%C3%A2ches-avec-suivi-sur-monespace)

You can use this method if you also want to track your orders on the Monespace web client application. Note that you must specify the email address of the account that has access to the application. Again, make sure to read the documentation for params expected by this method

- Example :

```php
$delivery = new Paps\Resources\Delivery($client);

// Email registered on your Monespace account
$email = "kiamet@example.com"

// Prepare your pickups params
$pickups = [
    [
        "address" => "Almadies, Dakar, Senegal",
        "name" => "Saliou Samb",
        "time" => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()),
        "phone" => "+221700000000",
        "job_description" => "Test Saliou"
    ]
];

// Prepare your delivery params
$deliveries = [
    [
        "address" => "Medina, Dakar, Senegal",
        "name" => "Modou DiakahtÃ©",
        "time" => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()),
        "phone" => "+221700000000",
        "job_description" => "Test Saliou"
    ]
];

// Pass your request
$response = $delivery->createTaskForAPIUser($email, $pickups, $deliveries);

// Read your response, hopefully successful.
echo json_encode($response);
```


### Create a standard [Delivery Request with a pickup](https://developers.paps.sn/create)

- Method : [`$delivery->create(array $delivery_params = []);`](https://developers.paps.sn/create#cr%C3%A9er-une-t%C3%A2che-de-pickup-et-delivery-li%C3%A9s)

Make sure to read the documentation before sending any requests.

- Example :

  'jobDeliveryDatetime' => '2019-01-14 12:00:00',
  'customerUsername' => 'Test Delivery Name',
  'customerAddress' => 'Urbam, Dakar, SÃ©nÃ©gal',

// Read your response, hopefully successful.
echo json_encode($response);
```

- Method : [`$delivery->submitQuotesRequest(array $quotes_params = [])`](https://developers.paps.sn/get-quotes#requ%C3%AAte-pour-obtenir-un-tarif)

You can get delivery quotes directly from the API. Usually, the rates are already communicated to you through the contract that you have approved or signed to start using Paps.

- Example :

// Prepare your request params
$quotes_params = [
  "origin" => "Medina, Dakar, Senegal",
  "destination" => "Almadies, Dakar, Senegal",
  "packageSize" => "small"
];

// Pass your request
$response = $delivery->submitQuotesRequest($quotes_params);

// Read your response, hopefully successful.
echo json_encode($response);
```

// Read your response, hopefully successful.
echo json_encode($response);
```

// Pass your request
$response = $delivery->listDeliveries(null, $start_date, $end_date, $select_by);
